*******************
* Group practice * 
*******************
*List the problems you attempted, your scores so far for each
*problem, and which Java API Classes and methods you used to solve
*each problem.
*Eg. SlowKeyBoard: 90 out of 90
*ArrayList (size, add, get), Arrays.sort

Problem1: InchWorm: 90 out of 90

Problem2: ThrowTheBall: 90 out of 90

Problem3: MooingCows: 90 out of 90
ArrayList (size, add, get, stream().sorted), Math(pow,abs)

Problem4: RugSizes: 90 out of 90

Problem5: SquareOfDigits: 90 out of 90
Math(max), String(charAt)

-- Reflection --
*Were the problems attempted in the lab easy/medium/challenging?
*After this practice, how confident you fill when solving this
*problem type?
*What else did you learn from the group practice?

In my opinion, InchWorm is easy, and ThrowTheBall and MooingCows
could be medium ones.
I'm quite confident in solving problems like InchWorm, but solving
problems like ThrowTheBall and MooingCows could take me more time.

************************
* Individual practice *
************************
*List the problems you attempted, and your scores so far for each
*problem, and which Java API Classes and methods you used to solve
*each problem.
*FracCount: 7 out 100
* HashMap (containsKey, put, get), ArrayList (size, add, get,
*remove)

Problem6: AlternateColors: 90 out of 100
String(equals)

Problem7: ChangingString: 100 out of 100
ArrayList(size, add, get, remove, stream().max, stream().mapToInt), Collections(replaceAll)

Problem8: PartySeats: 60 out of 100
ArrayList(size, add, addFirst, removeFirst, toArray), String(split), Arrays(sort)

-- Reflection --
*Explain the rationale behind your choice of individual practice.
*Which area you focused on improving (eg. speed, fluency, algorithmic
*design, coding)?
*What are your goals for the next block1 of practiceï¼Ÿ

I just choose the problems in order.
I prefer to improve my speed and algorithmic design, which can make me more effective.
My goal is to solve all problems in a short time in the next block1 of practice.
