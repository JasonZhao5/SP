*******************
* Group practice * 
*******************
List the problems you attempted, your scores so far for each 
problem, and which Java API Classes and methods you used to solve 
each problem.
Eg. SlowKeyBoard: 90 out of 90
ArrayList (size, add, get), Arrays.sort

Problem1
Problem2
-- Reflection -- 
Were the problems attempted in the lab easy/medium/challenging?
After this practice, how confident you fill when solving this 
problem type?
What else did you learn from the group practice?
************************
* Individual practice *
************************
List the problems you attempted, your scores so far for each 
problem, and which Java API Classes and methods you used to solve 
each problem.
FracCount: 7 out 100
 HashMap (containsKey, put, get), ArrayList (size, add, get, 
remove)
Problem3
Problem4
Problem5
-- Reflection -- 
Explain the rationale behind your choice of individual practice.
Which area you focused on improving (eg. speed, fluency, algorithmic 
design, coding)?
What are your goals for the next block of practiceï¼Ÿ
